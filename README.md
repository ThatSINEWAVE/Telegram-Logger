# Telegram-Logger
This utility enables seamless message logging to a Telegram channel via a straightforward Curl command, leveraging Telegram bot capabilities. It's designed for developers needing a quick and efficient way to send updates or logs to a Telegram channel directly from their scripts or applications.

## Usage
- Ensure you have curl installed on your system. Most Unix-like operating systems come with curl pre-installed.
- Use the provided Curl command template in your scripts or command line, replacing **(YOUR_BOT_KEY)** with your Telegram bot's API key and **(YOUR_CHAT_ID)** with the target Telegram channel or group ID.
